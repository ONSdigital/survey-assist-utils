"""This module contains pytest configuration and hooks.

It sets up a global logger and defines hooks for pytest to log events
such as the start and finish of a test session.

Functions:
    pytest_configure(config): Applies global test configuration.
    pytest_sessionstart(session): Logs the start of a test session.
    pytest_sessionfinish(session, exitstatus): Logs the end of a test session.
